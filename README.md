## Introduction to RFM Analysis
Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis is a technique commonly used in marketing and customer relationship management to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. It involves evaluating three key aspects of customer transactions:
- **Recency (R)**: How recently a customer made a purchase.
- **Frequency (F)**: How often a customer makes purchases.
- **Monetary Value (M)**: How much money a customer spends.

RFM analysis helps businesses gain insights into their customer base, identify high-value customers, understand customer segments, and tailor marketing strategies for better customer engagement and retention.
